= rotating-bucket-backup

rotating-bucket-backup is a Commodore component to manage S3 bucket backups.

The component creates a backup of an S3 bucket and stores it in another S3 bucket.
The component creates a new bucket for each day of the month and stores the backup in the corresponding bucket.
It then rotates by overwriting the corresponding bucket on the same day of the month.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
